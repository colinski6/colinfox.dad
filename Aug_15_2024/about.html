About this website:
</h2>
<p>
<tt>
This website is running on a VM in Google Cloud Platform. I am taking advantage of the 1 year/$300 free credit GCP offers to new users. <br>
The VM is an E2 micro running Debian.<br>
The server software is Apache<br>
<br>
Interested in making your own website like this one?<br>
Here's a quick guide:<br>
Make an account with Google Cloud Platform<br>
Create a VM instance. I chose E2 Micro and it seems to be working so far. Make sure the boxes to enable HTTP and HTTPS traffic are checked.<br>
Once your VM is running click the three lines in the top left corner then click VPC Network<br>
Click on IP Addresses and promote the ephemeral external address of your new VM to a permanent address <br>
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -make sure your shit is fresh.<br>
sudo apt install apache2<br>
You should now be able to type in the VM's IP address and see the default Apache homepage<br>
Change your DNS A records with your domain provider to point to the IP of your new VM<br>
Between waiting for DNS Records to resolve and how modern browsers avoid insecure http<br>
your site probably won't work when you type in the domain but don't worry, we'll figure this out later.<br> 
sudo nano /etc/hostnames then edit to say example.com<br>
sudo nano /etc/hosts and add a new line below the first: 127.0.1.1     example.com<br>
cd /etc/apache2/sites-available<br>
sudo touch example.com.conf<br>
sudo cp 000-default.conf example.com.conf<br>
sudo nano example.com.conf uncomment the line that says servername and then type your domain<br>
sudo systemctl a2dissite 000-default.conf<br>
sudo systemctl a2ensite example.com.conf<br>
sudo systemctl reload apache2<br>
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-apache<br>
sudo certbot --apache -d example.com then follow the prompts<br>
You should be able to load your site with your domain name and https!<br>
It will still be serving you the default apache page but now you can  paste whatever you want into /var/www/html/index.html<br>
Great Job! Now I made this cool link to take you back <a href=index.html>home</a>
